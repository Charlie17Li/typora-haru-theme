# Haru

## Introduction

`Haru` is a light style theme for Typora





## Screenshot





## Install

- Download `haru.zip` from Typora Gallery or from my github release





## Last but not least

- Actually, many ideas in `haru.css` are copied from my own website [汇尘轩](https://xn--lbun88i.studio/) directly, which contains an online markdown render.

- The open source html2pdf tools almost drive me mad :anger: , so I decide to go back to Typora and transfer the style I designed for my website to Typora, in order to enjoy the peace and inspiration which I have designed for myself :smile:
